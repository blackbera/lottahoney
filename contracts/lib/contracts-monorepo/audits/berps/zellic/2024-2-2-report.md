# Using Slinky Oracle Prices

## Getting oracle's price without checking timestamp may lead contract use older price when oracle provider is in trouble

### For example, In Trading.sol, `getPrice()` use `feedPrice1(answer)` from oracle, but dosen't check timestamp in return value of `latestRoundData()`

```solidity
function getPrice(uint256 pairIndex)
    private
    view
    returns (ITradingCallbacks.AggregatorAnswer memory)
{
    IPairsStorage pairsStorage = storageT.pairsStorage();
    require(pairsStorage.isPairIndexListed(pairIndex), "PAIR_NOT_LISTED");
    IPairsStorage.Feed memory f = pairsStorage.pairFeed(pairIndex);
    (, int256 feedPrice1,,,) =
        AggregatorV3Interface(f.feed1).latestRoundData();
    return ITradingCallbacks.AggregatorAnswer({
        price: PriceUtils.normalizePrice(
            feedPrice1, AggregatorV3Interface(f.feed1).decimals(), 10
            ),
        spreadP: pairsStorage.pairSpreadP(pairIndex)
    });
}
```

### But if provider(okx in your protocol) dosen't work or have some delay, price could be in older timestamp in returned. In this case, it becomse very dependent on okx api service health. So we recommend using _more providers_ to get price from multiple source, and get average price

We definitely want to use more providers for our oracle. This is something we are focusing on internally and want to
make sure the on-chain slinky oracle is a trusted reliable oracle source.

### Additionally, adding checking timestamp code prevent provider issues. Here is example code

```solidity
    (, int256 feedPrice1,,uint ts,) =
        AggregatorV3Interface(f.feed1).latestRoundData();
require(block.timestamp - ts <= 10s, "ORACLE_HEALTHY") // example code
```

I agree, we could definitely do a staleness check and revert. Even if it is stale right now, it is still the latest
price “on chain”, so it’s technically not inaccurate, but just stale. It would be much better to disallow orders/order
updates with stale prices though.

### [response] Not sure but we found original slinky does not use their timestamp which may lead getting stale prices, (not sure whether it is a trusted oracle source) so we recommend to use Chainlink tho

This is fair, we are working to have alternative oracle providers as well so we can ensure only a high quality, trusted
source is used. They will adhere to the same interface so the logic in our BTS contracts should not have to change,
aside from the staleness check. I will look further into slinky to understand whether their timestamp is useful or not.

[4/18 Followup] We will be using Pyth as the main oracle provider. Details rergarding the current implementation and safety
measures around prices can be found [here](https://github.com/berachain/contracts-monorepo/blob/main/src/berps/utils/PriceUtils.sol#L97).
