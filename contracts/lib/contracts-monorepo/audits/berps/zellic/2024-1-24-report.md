# Minor: Parameters in Trading contracts

## Actually, In Trading Contract, `require(t.openPrice * slippageP < type(uint256).max, "OVERFLOW");` is not required. because In solidity verison upper than 0.8.0 catch overflow automatically. You could delete this line

Noted, can remove this check from Trading.sol.

## There is potential risk `pairMaxLeverage` could set to be huge value by manager. `maxLeverage` is initialized in PairStorage in range of `maxLeverage <= 1000(MAX_LEVERAGE)`. But It could be override in TradingCallbacks contract using `setPairMaxLeverage` without restriction

`pairMaxLeverage` in TradingCallbacks is currently unused, but we can fix this by adding the simple check in
`_setPairMaxLeverage` which is:

```solidity
require(maxLeverage <= getPairsStorage().MAX_LEVERAGE(), "MAX_LEVERAGE_TOO_HIGH");
```
