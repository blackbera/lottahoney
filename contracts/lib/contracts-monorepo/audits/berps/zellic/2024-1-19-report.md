# TradingCallbacks: `limitFeeHoney` can be ignored when `a.price` and `newSl` (or `newTp`) are equal

## To summarize, the closing market order fee, `limitFeeHoney` could be ignored when `a.price` and `newSl`(`Tp` too) are equal. but when updating `TP` or `SL` in it’s callback, there is `canExecute` which checks whether `TP` or `SL` can be updated by `block.number`. So `a.price` can be change. But if `a.price` does not change during `canExecuteTimeout` block, this is still possible

### When unregistering the trade, closing market order is more expensive than triggering `TP` and `SL` because of `limitFeeHoney`. `true` represents user’s market close action and `false` is a triggered `TP` and `SL` action

```solidity
v.reward1 = marketOrder ? limitFeeHoney + closingFeeHoney : closingFeeHoney;
```

### However, even though `sl < openPrice < tp` in `openTrade`, but user can update `sl` to be same as `a.price` in `updateTp` and `updateSl`

```solidity
cancelReason = a.price == 0
    ? CancelReason.MARKET_CLOSED
    : (
        (t.buy != o.buy || t.openPrice != o.openPrice)
            ? CancelReason.WRONG_TRADE
            // o.newSl==a.price will be CancelReason.NONE
            : (t.buy ? o.newSl > a.price : o.newSl < a.price)
                ? CancelReason.SL_REACHED
                : CancelReason.NONE
    );
```

### Once the updated `sl` and `a.price` become equal, `SL` transaction will be triggered

```solidity
v.reward1 = (
    (
        o.orderType == ITradingStorage.LimitOrder.TP && t.tp > 0
            && (t.buy ? a.price >= t.tp : a.price <= t.tp)
    )
        || (
            o.orderType == ITradingStorage.LimitOrder.SL && t.sl > 0
                && (t.buy ? a.price <= t.sl : a.price >= t.sl)
        )
)
```

### Afterward, `unregisterTrade` will be invoked by bot, with `marketOrder` currently set to `false`, resulting in a value of `0`

```solidity
function unregisterTrade() {
    ...
    (honeySentToTrader,) = _getTradeValue(
        trade,
        currentHoneyPos,
        percentProfit,
        closingFeeHoney + (marketOrder ? limitFeeHoney : 0)  // here
    );
    ...
}
```

### Running TestTradingFee.t.sol outputs

```sh
[PASS] testTradingCloseMarket() (gas: 1462230)

  honey balance: 50000000000000000

```

My thinking is to prevent `tp` or `sl` from being updated to whatever the `a.price` (current price) is.

### [response] we are discussing this matter internally to determine whether it’s an issue, I will let you know our response once we have reached a conclusion, then we can discussion more about this

[4/19/24 Followup] With the current fixes to applying fees on position close, here are the results from running TestTradingFee.t.sol:

```sh
[PASS] testTradingCloseMarket() (gas: 1856536)
Logs:
  honey balance: 50000000000000000000
  honey balance: 93100000000000000000

[PASS] testTradingCloseSL() (gas: 1927372)
Logs:
  honey balance: 50000000000000000000
  honey balance: 43510000000008775000

[PASS] testTradingCloseTP() (gas: 1924353)
Logs:
  honey balance: 50000000000000000000
  honey balance: 93100000000000000000
```

As seen above, for a user closing their trade through market close or through executing a limit order (TP), it nets in
the user ending with the same amount of HONEY.
