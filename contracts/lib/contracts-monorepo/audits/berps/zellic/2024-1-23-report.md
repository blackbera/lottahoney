# Trading Considerations

## Before beginning, further in `2023-11-29-report.md` and `2023-12-06-report.md` that we had previously audited, we dug into the type casting bug lead to the maximum profit. We confirmed that the boundary check for tp works correctly but in case of sl, there was a similar bug discovered in another GMX protocol fork

### Howerver, In case of BTS: 1) `v.reward` must satisfy the condition `a.price <= t.sl` and 2) In `updateSlCallback`, there is `(t.buy ? o.newSl > a.price : o.newSl < a.price)` that means `t.sl <= a.price`

### Therefore, it is hard to have the `sl` value causing type casting issues, such as `0xffffffff~`

Can we solve this with setting both upper and lower bounds like how we did for tp? i.e. smth like this in `updateSl` in
Trading.sol:

```solidity
require(
    newSl == 0
        || (
            t.buy
                ? (newSl >= t.openPrice - maxSlDist) /* NEW */ && (newSl < t.openPrice)
                : (newSl <= t.openPrice + maxSlDist) /* NEW */ && (newSl > t.openPrice)
        ),
    "SL_TOO_BIG"
);
```

### The issue is: Trader contract can bypass max trades per pair. There is a limit on the number of trades a trader can have open, however, this limit can be bypassed by operating from multiple trading accounts or by using a contract that splits requested trades across multiple deployed proxies

```solidity
// Trading::openTrade
require(
    storageT.openTradesCount(sender, t.pairIndex)
        + storageT.openLimitOrdersCount(sender, t.pairIndex)
        < storageT.maxTradesPerPair(),
    "MAX_TRADES_PER_PAIR"
);
```

What do you guys suggest here? It seems there’s no way to prevent separate addresses from opening up more trades other
than bringing the max trades per trader per pair down? There is always the option to use more unique addresses.

### And we have two discussion points

### very huge tp/sp make evm revert. is this intended? Large values for `tp` and `sl` are restricted to the range of the maximum profit in `currentProfitPercent`, namely `900%` and `-75%`, respectively. However, if type casting results in values with changed signs, it may lead to over/underflow issues, resulting in an EVM Revert which seems not intended

If we add the remaining upper/lower bound checks (mentioned above), will this still be possible and if so, where?

### [response] revert was raised in calculating `currentPrecentProfit` (TradingCallbacks.sol#L870). To be honest, patching `currentPercentProfit` seems so good but not sure the possibility that it may lead side effects so it would be good to check tp and sl's boundary as below (and sl would be the same)

```solidity
function correctTp(
    uint256 openPrice,
    uint256 leverage,
    uint256 tp,
    bool buy
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    // check tp's boundary which not overflowed in TradingCallbacks.sol#L870
    if (
        tp == 0
            || currentPercentProfit(openPrice, tp, buy, leverage)
                == int256(MAX_GAIN_P) * int256(PRECISION)
    ) {
...
```

I got it, we should definitely add safety checks on all inputs to ensure all of `currentPercentProfit`, `correctTp`, and
`correctSl` pure functions do not revert. What was the specific revert reason/error that you noticed on
TradingCallbacks.sol#L870?

### [response] Yeah that would be good. The calculating part I mentioned as TradingCallbacks.sol#L870 was a part of `currentPercentProfit` to calculate `p` (the variable `p` should not be over/underflow, which can lead to a type casting bug)

```solidity
p = (
        (
            buy
                ? int256(currentPrice) - int256(openPrice)
                : int256(openPrice) - int256(currentPrice)
        ) * 100 * int256(PRECISION) * int256(leverage)
    ) / int256(openPrice);
```

[4/20/24 Followup] Type casting cannot be an issue because prices returned by pyth are at most the maximum of an `int64`.

### Even if the `sl` update fails, the fee is charged in `handleDevGovFees`. Is this an intended way?

```solidity
// TradingCallback::updateSlCallback()
v.reward1 = t.positionSizeHoney > 0
    ? storageT.handleDevGovFees(t.pairIndex, v.levPosHoney, false)
    : (
        storageT.handleDevGovFees(t.pairIndex, v.levPosHoney, false)
            * v.tokenPriceHoney
    ) / PRECISION;

// TradingStorage
function handleDevGovFees(...) external onlyTrading returns (uint256 fee) {
    fee = (_leveragedPositionSize * pairsStorage.pairOpenFeeP(_pairIndex))
        / PRECISION / 100;
    if (!_fullFee) fee /= 2;
    vault.distributeReward(fee);
}
```

### Even though `sl` update failed, but it emited `FeesDistributed` and charged fees, then emited `SlCanceled`

```sh
│   │   ├─ emit FeesDistributed(assetsToHoney: 65800000000000 [6.58e13], assetsToBGT: 28200000000000 [2.82e13], assetsTotal: 94000000000000 [9.4e13], vaultTVL: 1000000000000000485000000000000 [1e30])
│   │   └─ ← ()
│   └─ ← 94000000000000 [9.4e13]
├─ [2297] TradingStorage::updateTrade((0x0000000000000000000000000000000000011111, 0, 0, 93060000000000000000000000 [9.306e25], 9306000000000000 [9.306e15], 100000000000000000000 [1e20], true, 100, 101000000000000000000 [1.01e20], 99250000000000000000 [9.925e19]))

```

We have actually changed that logic. Now at the end of the updateSlCallback, we have added the require, which will
revert any tx that does not successfully update Sl:

```solidity
require(
    cancelReason == CancelReason.NONE,
    TradeUtils.getCancelReasonMsg(cancelReason)
);
```
