# BGT Rewards

## (released on 11-30-2023) We noticed that a vault depositor can increase their accBGT by simply transferring their vault tokens to another address (this can be one they also control, so they don't lose out on their deposit)

### Our proof of concept works from the first depositor standpoint, but the idea should work in general, although our understanding of the system might be incomplete, so let me know if you think this is not an issue

> I'll post the proof of concept in the next message, but in it, we did the following:

1. Assume that when deposits get enabled, 10e18 BGT is set aside for outstanding rewards at that moment
2. User1 deposits 1 wei of HONEY tokens to update the global available BGT variable. The reasoning behind depositing 1
   wei rather than all the HONEY tokens is because accBGTPerShare does not get updated here, since onMint() is called
   before the mint actually occurs in BToken.deposit(). Explained a bit more below.
3. Now, user1 waits for a bit more reward to accumulate (can be any amount, in this example, we assume the BGT rewards
   doubled to 20e18.
4. User1 now deposits the rest of their tokens (in this case, 10e18 - 1), this now causes onMint() -> updateGlobalBGT()
   to be called, which will also now trigger onMint() -> updateGlobalBGT(), which now sees that there's a total supply
   of 1 wei, and that there's 10e18 new available BGT (10e18 -> 20e18). This will now set accBGTPerShare to 1e37.
5. User1 now transfers their tokens to another account they control, let's call it User2. When they do this, their
   accBGT immediately gets set to 10e18, which is the amount of HONEY tokens they deposited. This can now be claimed
   basically immediately as well. User1 didn't have to really do anything to accrue these rewards.
6. User2 (who is also User1) can now just withdraw these tokens after making a withdraw request and waiting the
   appropriate number of epochs.

### With regards to step 5, I'm actually not sure why the user's accBGT gets set to 10e18. accBGTPerShare is 1e37, so it should be set to ((userShares _ accBGTPerShare) / PRECISION) - user.debtBGT , which would yield `(((10e18 - 1) _ 1e37) / 1e18) - 0`, which is a much larger number than 10e18, but yeah im not sure what's going on there, maybe you can help with that?

So you're correct in that, on step 5, the User1's `accBGT` gets set to 10e18. This is because the `userShares` in
`updateUserBGT()` is actually just `1` at this point in time. `userShares` is equal to the `balanceOf` User1's share
tokens, which is just 1. So the math then checks out to 10e18.

### One suggestion to prevent this would be to make it so that Berachain is the first depositor once the vault is enabled, so no random user gets to deposit 1 wei of HONEY and then be able to claim all BGT rewards that are accumulated later, because the accBGT calculation only cares about userShares (the amount of vault tokens the user has) and accBGTPerShare (which changes all the time, so the attacker can wait until its a good number)

### A summary of this issue and some other issues we found

- **A user can just transfer their vault tokens to another address to cause accBGT to increase without debtBGT
  increasing. This means they never really "accrue" rewards, they can instantly gain access to rewards with some careful
  setup.**

- **This is mentioned in the script in a comment, but onMint() is called before the mint ever occurs, so when the vault
  is first enabled, accBGTPerShare will actually still be set to 0 even after the first deposit is made. After this,
  accBGTPerShare can only ever be updated to another number if and only if getOutstandingRewards() returns a
  newAvailableBGT > 0. This is really finnicky code in our opinion, so could we get some clarification as to how
  accBGTPerShare is supposed to be updated? Should onMint() really be called before the mint?**

- **If a user ever transfers vault tokens to themselves (i.e user1 calls vault.transfer(user1, vault.balanceOf(user1))),
  the accounting gets bricked to the point where user1 will never be able to withdraw, transfer, or etc ever again,
  because all of these functions will trigger updateUserBGT(), which will now revert. You may test this out yourself and
  see it occurring, it's due to debtBGT being higher than the user's current vault balance. We recommend checking for
  self transfers like this and just turning them into a no-op.**

- Noted. I think its safe to just no-op self-transfers and not have to worry about that edge case in the accounting
  logic

### I will note that our suggestion of Berachain being the first depositor is not a full fix. We're struggling to understand how exactly a user accrues rewards, because right now it looks like simply transferring vault tokens out to another address is one method of instantly accruing rewards, which doesn't seem right

So the `accBGTPerShare`, `user.accBGT`, `user.debtBGT` are all accounting mechanisms used interally and actually working
as intended (with similar logic to Masterchef).
