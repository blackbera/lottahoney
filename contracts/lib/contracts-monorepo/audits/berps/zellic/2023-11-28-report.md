# BGT Rewards

## Yesterday we focused on auditing the PoLRewarder and BToken contracts. Today we continued with the BToken and Trading contracts, as well as the indexer and api services. We have a few questions regarding the reward mechanism used in BToken and PoLRewarder

### We have found what we believe is a critical issue. We noticed that BGT rewards are claimed using `BToken.claimBGT()` --> `PoLRewarder.harvestRewards()`, where `harvestRewards()` uses the `onlyOwner` modifier and is called externally. `harvestReward()` uses the `msg.sender`'s `accBGT` to determine how much rewards the user can claim / harvest. This is an issue because the `msg.sender` in this case will always be the BToken vault (since it is an external call through `claimBGT()`), and when `updateUserBGT()` is called, `feeAsset.balanceOf(receiver)` will take into account all HONEY tokens deposited by all users as it is checking the balance of the vault itself. This allows an attacker to claim rewards for all tokens deposited into the vault

Yeah, this is a clear an obvious error (recently introduced). Simple fix is to pass on the msg.sender from the BToken
vault `claimBGT()` call; should also be fine because of the `onlyOwner`, so then only the BToken vault can call
`harvestRewards()` with the appropriate `claimer` address.

### In the PoLRewarder contract, we noticed that `distributeFees()` is external and callable by anyone. We saw that it is called through `BToken.distributeReward()` with the first argument set to `msg.sender`, so we believe this is an issue as it would allow anyone to call `distributeFees()` and transfer out all $HONEY tokens from users that have approved PoLRewarder and distribute them as rewards. To determine impact, could we get some clarification around who is intended to call `distributeReward()`? We just want to figure out if it is intended for users to approve the PoLRewarder contract, or whether only the vault or admin approves that contract

It is intended primarily for the trading contracts (which holds the trades' $HONEY position collateral amounts) to call
`BToken.distributeReward()` for distributing the trade fees (which are always in $HONEY). Similarly, mostly only the
BToken contract would call `PoLRewarder.distributeFees()` to send the $HONEY fees from trading contracts to the PoL
system (`distributionModule`). /// Now if some other EOA approves PoLRewarder or directly calls
`distributeFees`/`distributeRewards`, they are giving their own $HONEY to the vault PoL system to be given out as
rewards for $HONEY depositors. Is this a bug? It is not intended for users to approve or send $HONEY to the
BToken/PoLRewarder directly ever.

### Ahh I see. We were looking at the Trading contract and also noticed that the TradingStorage contract is the one that holds all the assets for open trades, so having `PoLRewarder.distributeFees()` be callable externally would then allow anyone to distribute all HONEY tokens within the TradingStorage contract as fees for the BGT holders, which would break the system as there would be open trades with no assets to fulfill those trades

### Because of this, we still recommend adding an `onlyOwner` modifier to the `distributeFees()` function, so that the sender can't arbitrarily be specified by the caller

Ah true, this is another obvious one. Should be `onlyOwner` for the PoLRewarder because the `sender` is passed from
BToken.

### Could we get some clarification on the idea behind calculating rewards through `updateUserBGT`? Specifically, how is `debtBGT` supposed to be used? We noticed that `accRewards()` subtracts the `debtBGT` from the `accBGT` to determine the amount of reward tokens, but `harvestRewards()` does not. Is this intended?

This is intended. Before claiming, `harvestRewards()` calls `updateUserBGT()` which updates the newly `accBGT` (accrued)
and `debtBGT`. Then we just harvest whatever amount has been accrued up until this point in time. The rewards math logic
is heavily influenced by
[MasterChef](https://github.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-core/blob/main/contracts/MasterChefJoeV2.sol#L44).

### For `updateUserBGT()` specifically, it takes into account the receiver address's feeAsset (i.e HONEY) token balance. We think the intention here was to actually use the receiver's BToken (i.e bHONEY) token balance instead, as that determines how many HONEY tokens the receiver deposited into the vault. Could we get some clarification behind this too?

Yes, this is an obvious bug (also recently introduced). The fix is to use `vault.balanceOf()` and `vault.totalSupply()`
instead of the `feeAsset`'s. The rewards math is using share token and not asset token.

### For point 1, we wrote up a proof of concept test that demonstrates the exploit. I'll post the code in a reply to this message. Put this file under berachain-bts/contracts/test/custom and run it with `forge test -vvv --mt testClaimBGTExploit`: TestClaimBGTExploit.t.sol

Issue running forge tests:

### That looks like a copy paste error, so just confirming, did you download the file or copy paste the contents from Slack? I think Slack adds unicode characters in which won't work with the foundry solc compiler. I can put up the file on a gist as well if that helps

Yeah was just that copy/paste error; got the test to run.

### Note that `logUser()` requires a modification to the `PoLRewarder` contract - specifically, the `users` mapping must be made `public`

Would you recommend keeping the `users` mapping `private` or changing it to `public`? For the tests it helps, but was
wondering if there's any significant gas savings from keeping it `private`.

### With regards to gas savings, I did a quick test of just running testClaimBGTExploit with a `private` vs `public` `users` mapping (commented out the logUser() function for that). The total gas usage reported by foundry are as follows: (`private` - 334195, `public` - 334239). This is fairly negligible, so it's up to you really. I think having it be public allows external users to query for their own `accBGT` and `debtBGT` much easier, as otherwise they'd have to use foundry (or something similar) to read the contract's storage directly

### Will have an update for you later tonight, but we were just checking out your fix for updateUserBGT() and we have a few concerns. I know you mentioned earlier that the reward mechanism is influenced by the MasterchefV2 code, but to be honest we're having a difficult time understanding how rewards should be accumulated. I'll post more details in a thread under this message because there's a few things I want to mention here

### Is it possible to get some clarification about how rewards are accrued? I notice that deposits are disabled until rewardsModule.getOutstandingRewards() returns a non zero value, so my question is, what does a normal deposit -> redeem rewards flow look like? How would a user accrue BGT rewards

### Not talking about the reward math per se, but the general idea behind how the rewards are accrued. Do they just accrue over time once a user has deposited tokens

So the reason for disabling deposits until `rewardsModule.getOutstandingRewards()` returns a non zero value is to
perform in accordance with PoL. If the vault contract is not accruing any BGT rewards from the PoL system (i.e. because
no validator has began allotting a portion of / if not all of their BGT block rewards towards the perps vault contract),
we consider this perps system not to be a part of PoL. So by restricting deposits, we are essentially saying: the perps
system is not usable until perps is active in PoL.

Now perps should be an active participant of PoL as soon as governance passes that vote and validators begin pointing
their BGT emissions to the perps vault contract. At this point in time, the call to
`rewardsModule.getOutstandingRewards()` will now be > 0. If claimed rewards are included, the total rewards to a certain
contract is monotonically increasing.

Now, the total amount remaining to claim is what `rewardsModule.getOutstandingRewards()` returns. So this amount will
decrease after a claim, or when `rewardsModule.withdrawRewardsTo()` is called. So all the `rewardsModule` knows is that
a certain contract is accruing rewards (and how much that quantity is at any given time).

The role of `PoLRewarder` , similarly to `MasterChef` , is to now determine allocation of the vault contract’s totally
(or `global`) accrued BGT rewards to the individual depositor users; those who deposit $HONEY into the vault will
proportionately earn some of the vault’s accrued BGT rewards.

So the important distinction is that the `rewardsModule` independently handles PoL rewards accounting for certain
contracts. The vault contract is one such example of a contract that is accruing BGT rewards from the PoL system.

Meanwhile the `PoLRewarder` independently handles accounting of BGT rewards to the users of this vault contract. If the
vault “globally” got 10 outstanding BGT (from PoL), the job of `PoLRewarder` is to determine how much of that 10 BGT
each of the $HONEY depositors earned.

### Aside, BToken.pendingBGT() only calls rewarder.accRewards(owner) but doesn't return it
