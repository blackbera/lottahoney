# Contracts Initialization

## All initialize() functions as below are front-runnable

```sh
BorrowingFees.sol
BToken.sol
Pairinfos.sol
PairStorage.sol
Referrals.sol
TradingCallbacks.sol
TradingStorage.sol
```

### their `initialize()` have no access control modifier so anyone could call this directly, in other words, a user can front-run before initializing the contract

A standard fix here would be to create an owner during deployment and then only the owner can call the initialize the
function. I would assume we wouldn't go live with the contracts if we someone else initializes the contracts and we are
unable to, so does seem to be not super pressing. Lmk your thoughts.

### [response] Yeah we second that, but still seems good to have an owner and restrict the call of `initialize()` by anyone to have that kinda potential issue

Makes sense, will add `onlyOwner` to all `initialize()` functions.

[5/15 Followup] With all of the contracts being UUPSUpgradeable & deployed through erc1967 proxy pattern, it is not possible
to set storage during the constructor of the implementation contract and have that be read from during the initialize call
(through the proxy as delegatecall). We will still improve the deploy scripts and ensure that the implementation is created,
proxy deployed, and contract is initialized all atomically so it's not front-runnable.

### In BToken.sol, `totalDeposited` value can be wrong. In BToken, `intializeV2()` have no access control modifier so that anyone can call it. this may lead inconsistency at `totalDeposited`

```solidity
function initializeV2() external reinitializer(2) {
    storeAccBlockWeightedMarketCap();
    totalDeposited += totalRewards; // include all already distributed
        // rewards in
        // totalDeposited
}
```

### `initializeV2()` do `totalDeposited += totalRewards`; but `totalRewards` already added in `distributeReward()`

```solidity
function distributeReward(uint256 assets) external {
    ...
    totalRewards += honeyAssets;
    totalDeposited += honeyAssets;
    emit FeesDistributed(honeyAssets, bgtAssets, assets, tvl());
}
```

### so someone call initializeV2(), totalDeposited will be accumulated more, resulting in inconsistency

### here's test script about this

```solidity
function testTotalDepositedInconsistency() external {
    vm.startPrank(user1, user1);
    console.log("totalDeposited: %s", bHoney.totalDeposited());
    honey.approve(address(bHoney), type(uint256).max);
    bHoney.distributeReward(1); // just for simulating distributeReward is called from Trading
    console.log("totalDeposited: %s", bHoney.totalDeposited());
    // Actually totalDeposited was affected by rewards
    // trigger inconsistency
    bHoney.initializeV2();
    console.log("totalDeposited: %s", bHoney.totalDeposited());
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### which results

```sh
Running 1 test for test/custom/TestBToken.t.sol:TestBerachainContract
[PASS] testTotalDepositedInconsistency() (gas: 146036)
Logs:
  totalDeposited: 1000000000000000000000000000000
  totalDeposited: 1000000000000000000000000000001
  totalDeposited: 1000000000000000000000000000002

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 3.57ms
Ran 1 test suites: 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

I think the easy fix here is to add `onlyManager` to this `initializeV2()` function.

### [response] yes it's correct to set `onlyOwner` in `initializeV2()` but still have an inconsistency between `initializeV2`'s `totalDeposited` and `distributeReward`'s `totalDeposited`, so want to clarify the purpose of the variable `totalDeposited`. Please let me know your think

I agree, I don't see the purpose of adding the total rewards to `totalDeposited()` upon `initializeV2()`, when
`totalDeposited` already includes total rewards added into the vault; so will remove the
`totalDeposited += totalRewards;` from the function.

[5/14 Followup] `initializeV2()` has been fully removed from BToken.sol, but will ensure any logic regarding totalDeposited
is handled carefully if brought back for a future upgrade.
